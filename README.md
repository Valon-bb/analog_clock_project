# Analog Clock Project

This project involves creating an analog clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock is designed to display the current time accurately with hour, minute, and second hands. The project is responsive, ensuring it displays correctly on various devices.

## Features

- **Hour, Minute, and Second Hands**: The clock includes three hands that accurately display the current time.
- **Responsive Design**: The clock is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Pendulum Animation**: An additional feature of a pendulum has been added to enhance the visual appeal of the clock.

## Project Structure

- **HTML**: The HTML structure is fixed and cannot be modified. It includes the basic structure of the clock with placeholders for the hands and markings.
- **CSS**: Styles the clock, ensuring it is circular, and positions the clock hands and markings correctly. The CSS also ensures the clock is responsive.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the dynamic movement of the clock hands to reflect the current time. It also includes the logic for the pendulum animation.

## Additional Features

### Pendulum

A pendulum has been added below the clock face. This pendulum swings back and forth, adding a dynamic and aesthetic element to the clock. The pendulum's movement is calculated using a sine function to ensure smooth oscillation.

## Setup Instructions
